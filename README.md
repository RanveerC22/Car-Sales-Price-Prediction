# Car-Sales-Price-Prediction 

This project focuses on the car sales dataset and the
algorithm required to obtain the desired prediction. The data set is officially collected from cars24.com which describes the selling
price of second-hand vehicles based on other parameters such as mileage, km_driven etc. The purpose of this study is to discuss different algorithms that can
be applied to obtain the prediction and the variance of the data.

Roles & Responsibilities:

• Complete data preprocessing, which included removal of not significant parameters, handling null values, etc.

• Used multiple machine learning algorithms like Multiple Linear regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to predict the prices of second-hand cars on the basis of their mileage, kilometer driven and max power.

• Complete analysis of the machine learning algorithms by using different parameters and comparing the % of variance.
